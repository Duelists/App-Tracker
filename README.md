# Introducing App Tracker!

What is App Tracker:
- App Tracker is an all in one discord bot that is completely FREE to use for every single person.
- This bot was created to be able to track app updates for any app on the Apple App Store, and most importantly send you a notification whenever an app is updated.
- The bot will come in handy for many mod makers here on iOSGods as tracking app updates, notifying the mod maker and keeping a list of apps that need updated has been simplified. See the full list of features below for more information.
